This is my first app with react native, a course that i did at EggHead. With this app you can see infos about any github profile, like the repositories, the basic profile infos and take notes about this profile.


If you want to run this awesome app in your local machine, clone this repo, install [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and then run `react-native run-ios`, of course that you have to have installed Xcode.
